# Iterations

# Iterations is another word for loops, repeating a block of code over and over
# Without having to write the code multiple times, saving time

# 2 types of loops
# while loops
# For loops

# While loops
# A while loop  will continue to execute code while a condition is true
# if a condition is never true the while loop with never start

print ("2")
print ("3")
print ("4")

# For loops
# A For loop will iterate over iterable collection - lists/strings/dictionaries
# useful for when we want to use data in collection
# Do things to individual elements in a collection

# iterating through lists
