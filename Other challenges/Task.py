# Sam has been dumped by his girlfriend so he's gone into the local milk 
# bar to drown his sorrows. He has a budget, and there's a choice of three (or more) 
# milkshakes, 
# differently priced. The barman says, "What can I fix you?" and Sam can reply with a 
# number corresponding 
# to the relevant flavour - this list is displayed every iteration. 
# If he enters Q, he quits and leaves; the barman wishes him well in his search for love. 
# If he orders but can't pay he's thrown out.
