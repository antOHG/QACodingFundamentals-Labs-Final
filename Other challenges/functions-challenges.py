# 1)	Password checker:
# Write a function that has a list with some common passwords as strings (stored as a variable) inside it. Have an input statement that asks the user for a password. If the input matches any string from the list print ‘Use a safer password {password} is compromised’, else print ‘password is safe’. 
# 2)	Simple calc:
# Write a function that takes 2 numbers as user input and then adds/subtracts/multiplies them and prints out the results. Eg; if user enters 10 and 5 the print-out should read ‘ sum is x, sub is y and multiply is z’.
# 3)	Write a function that takes 3 numbers as arguments, and returns the highest number.    
# 4)	Write a function that accepts a number as user input and returns whether the number is odd or even. 
# 5)	Write a function that converts a user inputted string into uppercase. 
# 6)	Write a function that accepts a radius and returns the area of a circle – search online for the correct equation to use. 
# 7)	Write a function that takes a temperature in degrees Celsius as user-input and converts to Fahrenheit.
